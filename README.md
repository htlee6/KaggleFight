First, you need to download the codes. If you have installed `git` then do this in your terminal.

git clone https://github.com/w29593617/KaggleFight.git /YourDestination
```
Then, some common python packages are used in our programms, like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy` and so on.

1. Digit Recognize

    Digit recognization is a typical problem for machine learning or data mining staters. It's famous for the MNIST dataset.
    ```shell
    cd DigitRecognize
    python3 main.py
    ```
    And see the result.
